# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python !
[~ By Mayuresh Patil]()

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

## Dependencies
```
pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow,
```

## The MNIST dataset
This is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Create the model
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Create GUI to predict digits
